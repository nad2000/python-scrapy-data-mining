# Product similarity analysis and categorization / clustering


> I am crawling an e commerce website (bukalapak) using Python scrapy. For a product, I hope to count the number of similar products on this site.
> The difficulty is to konw whether two products (with different icons and titles) are the same. Hope to find a data mining professional for this work.
